            <p class="text">I was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona, attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and currently reside in Orem, Utah. I graduated from Brigham Young Univeristy April 2019 with a degree in English Teaching and a Minor in Digital Humanities. This was after a year long teaching internship at Diamond Fork Junior High in Spanish Fork, where I have been working for the last year. After two years of teaching, I've decided to move into full-time web development! This was prompted by teaching the junior high's elective coding classes and running the Girls Who Code club at the same school.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text" id="last">I have a two-year-old MaltiPom, who I love! My favorite food is nacho cheese (Nacho Fries from Taco Bell are my weakness). In my free time, I enjoy boating, skiing, weightlifting, reading, and gaming. "Paper Mario & the Thousand Year Door" is one of my favorites. Something few people know about me is that I placed first in a Jiu Jitsu turnament in college!</p>
